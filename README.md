# NYTimesTweetTrends

Twitter is a popular social networking site that used by a variety of people for a variety of reasons.  
One of the most interesting aspects of Twitter is that it provides users with real-time updates from users 
all over the world.  The problem explored by this work is to determine what effect, if any, a Twitter 
presence has on interest in a website. An analysis of traffic patterns for a sampling of articles at the 
New York Times website has been performed and compared to the Twitter contributions made by the official 
New York Timesâ€™ Twitter account (@nytimes).

Over the course of one week, @nytimes generated 362 tweets that reference an article from its website.  
On average, we found a significant increase in the rate of user comments for comments that were tweeted by @nytimes.
